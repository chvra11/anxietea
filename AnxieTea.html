						<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
						<br>
						<p>	Over 18% of adults and 25% of teens suffer from some form of anxiety, making anxiety one of the most
						widely experienced mental illness in the United States. AnxieTea was founded to help people better understand

						those with the mental illness and those in their lives as well. We work to provide a multitude of resources that allow 
						people to identify with the actual experience of having anxiety and educate themselves on the illness itself. 
						By doing this, we hope to fulfil our goal of helping friends and family improve how they assist their loved ones 
						work through the difficult symptoms of anxiety. AnxieTea is proud to provide the resources needed to help alleviate 
						the experiences of anxiety.

											The first time we met was near a bathroom at the theatre. 
											He was bent over the sink, jagged exhales coming out of pale lips, and when he looked up, his hands balled up into tiny fists, he asked if I ever got like this. I told him no, but I thought he was beautiful. 
											<br>
											He laughed. It was shaky, and on a melodic beat, he collapsed, explaining that sometimes he just got these crippling sensations and that it was wracking through his skin and sometimes he just needed someone to grab him and make him remember that he was there or he would drift off like an untied boat in the ocean, so I did. You're going to be okay, I said, as I decided I wanted to hold both his body and his heart. 
											<br>
											I held him then as he cried, and I held him six months after that, while he dug his nails into his wrists and whispered curses under his breath until the shopkeepers kicked us out for profanity. He told me the only time he wasn't afraid of loud noises was when I was yelling to him across the room, and the only time he loved not being able to breathe was when we kissed so hard his heart stopped. 
											<br>
											We went back to the theatre yesterday, and I held him one last time while we say on the washroom counter, and I exhaled against his lips because his mouth couldn't do anything but tremble.He told me I love you, so much. I really do, but I just can't. 
											<br>
											This morning I found myself trembling over my bathroom sink, and I finally get it, but this time there's no one to tell me I'm beautiful, and no shaking hands to hold my heart and remind me that I'm going to be okay.

											"Anxiety Attack"
											<br>
											J.D.
											<br><br>
											Anxiety: n. A nervous disorder characterized by a state of excessive uneasiness and apprehension, typically with compulsive behavior or panic attacks.
											<br><br>
											Most people don't understand what anxiety truly is. 
											<br>
											They use it to describe themselves in awkward or uncomfortable situations, but they don't know the extent of true anxiety. They don't know what it is like to go to school every day with an intense feeling of panic or loss of control. 
											<br>
											Reader, I am trusting you. I am trusting you with my inner most thoughts and experiences. I am trusting you with all of my hopelessness. I am trusting you with everything personal I typically clutch close to my heart.
											<br><br>
											Don't let me down.
											<br><br>
											Most people do.
											<br><br>
											My name is Jesse, but the few people that do talk to me call me Jess. I am 16 years old, and have been diagnosed with clinical depression and severe anxiety.
											<br>
											Most people wouldn't know how messed up I truly am. I guess I put up a better front than I realize most of the time. I would typically be classified as the class nerd/clown. 
											<br>
											I'm the girl that always has a smile on her face.
											<br><br>
											I guess when you fake being happy for long enough you can start to convince even yourself that you're not hurting inside.
											<br><br>
											And so I am starting my story on the pretense that you have not experienced some of the same things as I have, and before I begin my story, I must explain how I am affected by these, what may be considered, disorders. 
											<br>
											It is vital to the story. Remember it.
											<br><br>
											I am being presumptuous, Reader, and assuming that you have been lucky enough to not experience as much anxiety as I have thus far in my life. 
											<br>
											I am assuming that you live a happy life, an easy life. And that may not be necessary, and I wish not to be offensive. 
											<br>
											Rather, I hope to educate you of my own situation, as I have no one else to educate. As my anxiety cripples me when I attempt to share these thoughts with anyone else. 
											<br>
											But, you are just a creation of my own imagination, and so I know my thoughts are safe with you.
											<br><br>
											And as it vital to the story, and Reader it is very vital, I hope you do not mind if I proceed to explain my own experience with anxiety. 
											<br>
											Keep this in mind as my story proceeds, it is very important. 
											<br>
											I will paint an image for you so you may understand.
											<br><br>
											The one person that knows of my situation, the only person I have ever trusted with this knowledge, did not understand how I could have anxiety. 
											<br>
											I function fairly well, and seem to be able to communicate. 
											<br>
											And perhaps I am lucky to be able to do so.
											<br><br>
											Or perhaps I have taught myself to act as if I know how to act in social situations. Perhaps it is simply a mask meant to hide what I am feeling inside.
											<br><br>
											No matter how well I function, I am always anxious.
											<br><br>
											I always feel as if there is some invisible man gripping and pulling at my chest. 
											<br>
											We participate in a daily tug-of-war tournament. 
											<br>
											He usually wins.
											<br><br>
											Often I experience a shortness of breath. I can't seem to be able to get enough air in, which sets the anxiety off more. 
											<br>
											I have a constant feeling of panic planted deep in my chest, worrying if I appear to be fine, if anyone can see past the facade.
											<br><br>
											In school, I lose myself in my work. 
											<br>
											It is the only thing I can do to not focus on the fact that I have been stuffed in a classroom with other people for 85 minutes at a time. 
											<br>
											It is the only thing I can do to pretend as if the invisible man isn't slowly stealing all of my breath. 
											<br>
											It is all I can do to pretend that I am not so close to so many people, that the walls aren't caving in at a slow rate, making the room grow smaller and tighter in every moment. 
											<br>
											It is the only thing I can do to distract me from the fact that I am close enough to the person next to me that our legs are almost touching. 
											<br>
											It is the only thing I can do to pretend that my claustrophobia isn't starting to rise again, that I feel as if there are too many people in too small of a space. 
											<br>
											It shouldn't bother me, but it does. It doesn't appear to bother anyone else around me, so why does it add to the deep pit that rests constantly in my chest?
											<br><br>
											And with the anxiety comes the headaches. 
											<br>
											With the stress of making sure that no one can tell that I am different, not normal, it is a given that there would be headaches to accompany them. 
											<br>
											At this point, I barely notice them. They are just a constant, slow dull pain that expands across my whole skull.
											<br><br>
											As my day progresses, the deep feeling in chest grows slowly but surely. 
											<br>
											Am I happy enough? 
											<br>
											Am I smiling enough yet? Did I have a deep expression on my face earlier? Oh god, I had a deep expression on my face earlier. 
											<br>
											Did anyone notice? I can't let anyone notice. No one can know how I feel. No one can know what is inside. What if they start asking questions? 
											<br>
											What if I can't answer them? What then? Am I acting normal enough? What if they think I'm not normal? What if they think I'm acting weird? 
											<br>
											Will they not talk to me? Will they start asking questions? I can't answer their queries. I can't let them know. Am I sitting too straight? Is it normal to sit this straight? 
											<br>
											Am I slouching too much? There's that look again! No, Sam, smile now. Is that smile too big? Is it not big enough? Oh god, am I acting weird now? 
											<br>
											Are they going to start asking questions? I can't answer their questions. 
											<br>
											They can't know.
											<br><br>
											And so the day progresses and these thoughts constantly rattle around my head and the pit grows deeper and wider. And I continually grow more worried, more stressed, more anxious. 
											<br>
											Sometimes it grows unbearable, and I have to remind myself that I am not allowed to break down in public. The panic sets in, and I try to push it away, to no avail.
											<br><br>
											And as the anxiety grows worse, so does my communication. Slowly, I lose the ability to properly convey my thoughts. My words become all jumbled and my sentences lose structure.
											<br>
											This only worsens my anxiety, which in turn worsens my communication. Soon, the stuttering starts. 
											<br>
											It usually isn't so bad, only when I get really flustered, but recently it has grown to be worse than I am used to. 
											<br>
											In class, I try to pronounce a word several times to no avail. A laugh escapes my lips as I try to talk around it, only to stumble over my own words and begin the stuttering again. 
											<br>
											Tears well in my eyes, but I hide them and refuse to let them fall. No one can know I am weak. They can't ask questions. They can't know. 
											<br>
											And soon I feel the stares of my classmates on my face as I avoid their curiously judgmental gazes and attempt to share what I had meant to say.
											<br><br>
											On a good day, I wait until I get back to the privacy of my own home before I break down and start crying, 
											<br>
											allowing the panic to flow through me until it subsides enough for me to put myself back together, to place the smile back on my face.
											<br><br>
											On a bad day, I just try to get to my car.
											<br><br>
											And so I fall asleep, and wake up, and restart the cycle again.

											You are his home,

											<br>
											<a href = "https://www.wattpad.com/user/alexxxaa_33" target = "_blank">Alexa S.</a>
											<br><br>
											Anxiety,
											<br><br>
											You're the reason I need to shake my leg or shake my fingers. You're the reason I have this overwhelming fear all the time. You're always there in the center of my mind, never leaving. 
											<br>
											I can't escape the walls you've put around me. I want out, but you've trapped me. I've tried calling for help, but you mute me when I speak. 
											<br>
											The voice I've been holding inside tries to find it's way out, climbing up my throat, threatening to spill. When you finally let me out, I look at others differently.
											<br>
											They make me uncomfortable... Too uncomfortable. You won't let me see them in the same way. I've known these people my whole life, and suddenly... I don't know them anymore. 
											<br>
											You lock me up so tight that I've lost myself. So far deep into loneliness that the only thing I know is silence. To break those walls down, is what causes depression.
											<br>
											I try so hard to demolish what keeps me so deep inside, only to be pushed deeper. You knocked on a door that I can no longer answer. Once you came in, you boarded it up, giving me no hope that you'll ever leave. 
											<br>
											A constant reminder that I'm never going to be truly alone. I'll always have you in my mind, telling me how to think. I want the scars you've given me to disappear. 
											<br>
											They are a constant reminder of who I have become and what you've done to me. Pushing me so far, that I've fallen into a puddle of self hate. Others have started to hate me too. 
											<br>
											It seems like you stop time for a split second, allowing me to see what they see in me. I can't blame them, Because you've forced me into a place that I didn't agree to check into. 
											<br>
											They keep me here to destroy you. But, you were too powerful for even the professionals to defeat. I try to sleep here, but you keep me awake with racing thoughts. 
											<br>
											They're running so fast that I cannot possibly keep up. When they pass me, they knock me down. Again, and again, so that I can't get up. I wish to stand again. 
											<br>
											You attack me, clawing at my throat, preventing me from breathing. You make giving up seem like an easier option when you try to end me. Who do I go to when I would rather end myself first?
											<br><br>
											Love, The one you destroyed.

						<p><strong>Why Girls Who Code?</strong> &nbsp; 
						I was first introduced to Computer Science in my junior year of high school.
						I knew it was something I wanted to explore more, as I developed an immediate interest in it, and Girls Who Code was the perfect opportunity for me.</p>
						<p><strong>Why an Anxiety Website?</strong> &nbsp; 
						I have some really close friends who suffer from anxiety and have seen how it affects them.
						I have also seen how others respond to someone suffering from an attack, and I realize 
						that if people were a bit more educated on the mental illness, 
						a more comfortable environment could be created for everyone involved.</p>

						<p><strong>Why Girls Who Code?</strong>&nbsp;
						I’ve always been interested in computers and technology. Growing up, I was always tinkering with (or as my siblings 
						would describe it- breaking) any device I could get my grubby little hands on. When I started high school, I kept this 
						interest. I joined my school’s SWATT (Students Working to Advance Trinity Technology) team as well as our Girls Who
						Code club. I enrolled in one of the only advanced technology-based courses to learn more about technology and how people 
						interact with it. This course, ITGS- or Information Technology in a Global Society- teaches the connection between morality
						and computers. I’ve worked more directly with hardware, but I wanted to experience the software that is used in these devices 
						as well. I took some online coding courses, and began to grasp the concept little-by-little. When my science teacher pushed me 
						to apply for the program, however, I was actually slightly reluctant. I didn’t know if I was willing to give up the majority
						of my summer. However, after seven weeks, I am coming out of Girls Who Code with the ability to code in nine different 
						languages and a deeper love for computer science.</p>
						<p><strong>Why an Anxiety Website?</strong>&nbsp;
						I myself experience social anxiety. I am not as affected as most, but it is definitely with me during every decision I 
						make. It’s hard for me to put myself out there, and I often have to almost physically push myself out of my comfort zone 
						as not to miss out on experiences. My little brother also deals with severe anxiety. It has been incredibly hard for him 
						lately, and at some points it’s so bad he can’t even go to school. My family and his friends don’t exactly know how to deal 
						with this, or how to help. They are almost as lost as he is in the situation. I’d like to think that if they all had a
						resource like this, maybe it would be easier for him to manage his anxiety. </p>

						<p><strong>Why Girls Who Code?</strong> &nbsp;
						Girls Who Code is an amazing program that allowed me to decide whether or not I was interested
						in Computer Science. I got to meet some amazing girls who became my second family. We learned lots and we 
						had a lot of fun while doing it.</p>
						<p><strong>Why an Anxiety Website?</strong>&nbsp;
						I, personally, suffer from panic disorder. I wanted to create a website that would help 
						other people understand what I go through and help other people like me have a safe place to go.</p>

						<p><strong>Why Girls Who Code?</strong>&nbsp;
						 I choose GCW because I wanted to experience different educational 
						 paths in order to choose my major for college next year.</p>
						<p><strong>Why an Anxiety Website?</strong>&nbsp;
						I decided to collaborate with others in building the anxiety site because I have many
						problems with anxiousness. I am very adamant when it comes to figuring out how to solve
						this problem. I want to be able to help others through anxiety, which comes from anxiousness.</p>

						<p><strong>Why Girls Who Code?</strong> &nbsp; 
						I chose Girls Who Code because it was something I had never found interest in, 
						and I didn’t know much about Girls Who Code or coding. It was something new I wanted to try.</p>
						<p><strong>Why an Anxiety Website?</strong> &nbsp; 
						I decided to be apart of creating the anxiety website because anxiety is something 
						that I believe the world should learn more about. 
						I also believe that people should know how to help themselves with and others.</p>
